METHODS
    * new(%p)
        This method takes a hash of parameters. The following options are
        acceptable.

        * name ($)
                The name of the object. Required.

        * min_level ($)
                The minimum logging level this object will accept. See the
                Log::Dispatch documentation for more information. Required.

        * max_level ($)
                The maximum logging level this obejct will accept. See the
                Log::Dispatch documentation for more information. This is
                not required. By default the maximum is the highest possible
                level (which means functionally that the object has no
                maximum).

        * app_name ($)
                The Application Name registered to Growl. By default, the
                package name will be registered.

        * priority ($)
                The priority number (range from -2 for low to 2 for high)
                passed to Growl. By default, 0 (normal) will be passed.

        * sticky ($)
                The Stickiness (boolean) passed to Growl. By default, 1
                (sticky) will be passed.

        * icon_file ($)
                The icon file (.icns) path shown on each notification
                window. By default, nothing will be passed.

    * log_message( message => $ )
        Sends a message to the appropriate output. Generally this shouldn't
        be called directly but should be called through the "log()" method
        (in Log::Dispatch::Output).

DEPENDENCY
